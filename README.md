ABC-(Assisted Bearing Condition Status Detection for Sustainable Refurbishment) 
project description--
The goal of this project is to develop AI models for image classification problem that is integrated into a graphical user interface (GUI) to assist domain experts in determining whether the bearing images that are fed into the GUI are classified as defective or non-defective at the surface level and also aids in making a decision on whether the bearings can be used continuously, or if they need to be replaced or refurbished. As a result, they will be able to use the AI model's predictions to make an informed decision.
